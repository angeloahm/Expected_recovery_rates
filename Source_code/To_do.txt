1. We need a Speudo-code explaining exactly how this code works.
2. We need another Speudo-code but this time with the new version:
    2.1 b>0 is debt.
    2.2 The grid for both bonds is allowed to have only one element, and that element to be zero.
    2.3 Perform all the checks and then an only then start thinking about optimization.
3. In order to check the results we will also want to write a psuedo code on what the MATLAB routine will do.
4. We havent made much progress regarding the simulations.
